# Black-Fungus-Analysis-using-Deep-Learning
Final year project

# Plan:
This is a Group project which allow machine to analyse the user image weather it have black fungus symptoms or not if Yes displays "Positive" Else "Negative".

# Database:
We as a group created our own dataset which is tested and trained uing different deep learning algorithms.
# Algorithms Used is:
Resnet, Densenet, VGG-19, Inceptionnet, Efficientnet.

# Report:
>>Few Algorithms got good accuracy and we continue with those only.
>>
>>Database is Tested and Trained successfully.
>>
>>UI is also Implemented to demonistrate the project.
>>
>>problem with new images that is machine not showing accurate result for new images given by user.
